### 20. Valid Parentheses 
* A really easy one to learn the idea of Stack
* Got the Java functions knowledge quickly from ChatGPT - a really good tool to help giving me a great number of related functions I need

### 94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal 
*  Inorder: left child, root, right child
*  Recursive solution is easy to understand and write
*  Learned the iterative way: an interesting approach using stack

### 144. Binary Tree Preorder Traversal 
* Similar idea as 94, this time root, left child, right child 
* But felt a little bit wierd, because using a stack I had to push right child first then left child
