### 102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal 
* Used pre order traverse and dfs.

### 103. Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal 
* Inorder traversal is a smart way but I think using queue for bfs is better. 

### 105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal 
* Can get the idea from the definitions of each traversal. Can use map to speed up. 

### 106. Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal 
* Similar problem. Used map this time.
