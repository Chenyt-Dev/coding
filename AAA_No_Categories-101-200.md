### 102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal 
* Used pre order traverse and dfs.

### 103. Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal 
* Inorder traversal is a smart way but I think using queue for bfs is better. 

### 105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal 
* Can get the idea from the definitions of each traversal. Can use map to speed up. 

### 106. Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal 
* Similar problem. Used map this time. 

### 107. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II 
* Still used dfs. Just inserting the values reversely. BFS is also good to use. 

### 108. Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree 
* Used recursive way. 

### 109. Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree 
* A sorted array can be treated as a preorder traversal.

### 110. Balanced Binary Tree 
* Do a dfs and return the heights (or minus value as inbalanced). 

### 111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree 
* Used dfs and had to take care of each corner cases. Had to say bfs is much better here. 

### 112. Path Sum 
* Find a path and stop. 

### 113. Path Sum II 
* Use dfs to traverse the tree.
* When calculating the time complexity, need to consider the time to copy the path.
