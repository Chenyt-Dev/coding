// MULTIPLE meaning good for looking back again in the future 

### 2. Add Two Numbers 
* This is a linked list problem. As the list is reversed, it's easy to implement. 

### 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters 
* A two-pointer one.
* Need to write it clean.
* Can use hash set or array to store the existing chars.

### 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays 
* Good one for binary search, boundries checks
* MULTIPLE

### 5. Longest Palindromic Substring 
* Dp way is faster
* Center expanding is trivial but good to practice
* MULTIPLE

### 6. Zigzag Conversion 
* Missed a corner case at first but should use a more general way. 

### 7. Reverse Integer 
* Need to check the problem descriptions carefully. There are some constraints.

### 8. String to Integer (atoi) 
* Using long is easier to handle the edge cases. 

### 9. Palindrome Number 
* Reverse the number and compare.
* Reverse half of the number is also working.

### 10. Regular Expression Matching 
* A good one for a introduction of dp.
* Need to consider each case but not very complicated.
* MULTIPLE

### 11. Container With Most Water 
* Not a regular algorithm, need to think about the strategy of movements. 

### 12. Integer to Roman 
* Too easy but costs time to write. Should not be a good one.

### 15. 3Sum
* Two pointer solution. O(n^2)
* It's easy to implement after looking at the solutions.
* Need to figure out what is the fastest approach, what is the best possible complexity.
* MULTIPLE

### 16. 3Sum Closest
* Similar to 15 but just need to maintain a closest value. 
* Can use Math.abs but I used 2 values(for + and -) which is redundent. 

### 17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number 
* Can use recursive function or fifo queue.

### 18. 4Sum 
* Approach good for problems > 4 as well.
* Need to pay attention to integer overflow.
* MULTIPLE

### 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List 
* An easy one. Use 2 pointers.

### 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists 
* Good and easy one.
* Could do recursive and iterative.
