// MULTIPLE meaning good for looking back again in the future 

### 2. Add Two Numbers 
* This is a linked list problem. As the list is reversed, it's easy to implement. 

### 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters 
* A two-pointer one.
* Need to write it clean.
* Can use hash set or array to store the existing chars.

### 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays 
* Good one for binary search, boundries checks
* MULTIPLE

### 5. Longest Palindromic Substring 
* Dp way is faster
* Center expanding is trivial but good to practice
* MULTIPLE

### 6. Zigzag Conversion 
* Missed a corner case at first but should use a more general way. 

### 7. Reverse Integer 
* Need to check the problem descriptions carefully. There are some constraints.

### 8. String to Integer (atoi) 
* Using long is easier to handle the edge cases. 

### 9. Palindrome Number 
* Reverse the number and compare.
* Reverse half of the number is also working.

### 10. Regular Expression Matching 
* A good one for a introduction of dp.
* Need to consider each case but not very complicated.
* MULTIPLE

### 11. Container With Most Water 
* Not a regular algorithm, need to think about the strategy of movements.
