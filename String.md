### 28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String 
* A really easy and good one to start String problems

### 58. Length of Last Word 
* Simple idea
* There is an interesting thing though, using .trim() is faster than manually moving the index to skip the spaces
* This is because inside of the trim() function, char[] is being used -> using array directly is faster than calling .charAt(index) multiple times. 

### 67. Add Binary
* Multiple ways to implement this. This is just a sumulation of the binary addings.
* Found an interesting usage of StringBuilder - it could handle various of types like int, bool, char... which makes this problem easier. 

### 13. Roman to Integer 
* Just need to simulate the process. Simple question.
* For speeding, it's better to not using the hash map. But use something like arrays, case. 

### 14. Longest Common Prefix 
* Multiple solutions.
* Thought using substring is a good idea. 

### 125. Valid Palindrome 
* Learned some Character's build-in functions. 

### 168. Excel Sheet Column Title 
* Waste some time on this.
* Need to think clearly before writing code. 

### 171. Excel Sheet Column Number 
* Easy one
