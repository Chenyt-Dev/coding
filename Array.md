### 1. Two Sum 
* First problem in this year.
* Just scan from 0 to end. Know the idea but forgot the functions. 
* Searched functions like HashMap, int[], containsKey, put, get in Java. 

### 26. Remove duplicates from sorted array 
* No need to learn anything, easy one

### 27. Remove Element 
* Easy one

### 35. Search Insert Position 
* The idea of binary search 

### 66. Plus One 
* Idea is simple. Need to write it clean.

### 88. Merge Sorted Array 
* Simple idea.
* But easy to make mistakes with the indexes. 

### 118. Pascal's Triangle 
* Different ways: recursion, math, dp.
* I use recursion, simplest approach.
* Learned List<Integer> in Java. 

### 119. Pascal's Triangle II 
* Same idea as 118. I use recursion again.
* Note that I just use a 1-D array to generate it. To avoid overwriting, need to update the numbers from back to beginning for each row.
