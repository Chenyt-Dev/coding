### 201. Bitwise AND of Numbers Range 
* So many tricks in bits.

### 202. Happy Number 
* Two pointers could save space. Using set seems has less operations. 

### 203. Remove Linked List Elements 
* Used one pointer. Can also do recursively. 

### 204. Count Primes 
* Used the way to start from 2, then delete all the not prime numbers. 

### 206. Reverse Linked List 
* Both iterative and recursive are fine. Iterative seems easier to write.

### 207. Course Schedule 
* Topology sort.
