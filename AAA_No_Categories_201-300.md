### 201. Bitwise AND of Numbers Range 
* So many tricks in bits.

### 202. Happy Number 
* Two pointers could save space. Using set seems has less operations. 

### 203. Remove Linked List Elements 
* Used one pointer. Can also do recursively. 

### 204. Count Primes 
* Used the way to start from 2, then delete all the not prime numbers. 

### 206. Reverse Linked List 
* Both iterative and recursive are fine. Iterative seems easier to write.

### 207. Course Schedule 
* Topology sort. 

### 208. Implement Trie (Prefix Tree) 
* Just implement the Trie tree. 

### 209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum 
* A sliding window question. 

### 210. Course Schedule II 
* Same topology sort, just need to output the order. 

### 211. Design Add and Search Words Data Structure 
* Used trie. For general matching character have to go through each child. 

### 212. Word Search II 
* Trie again. This time need to store the word and do a dfs.

### 213. House Robber II 
* Can reuse helper functions.
